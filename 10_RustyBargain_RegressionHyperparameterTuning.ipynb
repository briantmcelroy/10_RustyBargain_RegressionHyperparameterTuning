We should convert these features to datetime.\n",

    "There are missing values for 'VehicleType', 'Gearbox', 'Model', 'FuelType', and 'NotRepaired'. The first four of these features are categorical and thus difficult to fill in with representative data like a median. We don't want to drop that many entries, so we should create an \"other\" category for all NaN values. For the final feature, 'NotRepaired', we can instead create an \"unknown\" category, which better reflects why there is a missing value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the \"PostalCode' column is tricky. It corresponds to a float number, but realistically, it must be treated as categorical, since a zip code of 90000 is not 9 times as influential on the price as 10000. It would be worrisome, however, to create 100000 different categories. We can first reduce this feature load by a magnitude of 100 by grouping zip codes to their post office number, which is represented by the first three numbers. This creates a meaningful grouping of the postal codes. We should change this column to a three-digit string (or two-digit in the case of zip codes beginning with 0)."
